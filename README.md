##Grading Criteria
* You are being graded on your analysis more than anything else. Roughly speaking, implementing everything and getting it to run is worth maybe 0% of the grade on this assignment (I know you don't believe me, but in fact, steal the code; I not only don't care, I am encouraging you to use one of the many packages available both from the resources page and on the web). Of course, analysis without proof of working code makes the analysis suspect.

* The key thing is that your explanations should be both thorough and concise. Imagine you are writing a paper for the major conference in your field the year you will be graduating and you need to impress all those folks who will be deciding whether to interview you later. You don't want them to think you're shallow do you? Or that you're incapable of coming up with interesting classification problems, right? And you surely don't want them to think that you make up for a lack of content by blathering on about irrelevant aspects of your work? Of course not.

* Finally, I'd like to point out that I am very particular about the format of the assignments. Follow the directions carefully. Failure to turn in files without the proper naming scheme, or anything else that makes the graders' lives unduly hard is simply going to lead to an ignored assignment. I am remarkably inflexible about this. Also, there will be no late assignments accepted, so start now. Have fun. One day you'll look back on this and smile. There may be tears, but they will be tears of joy.
